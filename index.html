    <li><p><b>Summary</b><br>
             <i>A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. ... Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers.</i>
<br>

<b>Challenge</b><br>
<i>Population growth, the need for enhanced economic activity for livelihood and food security, and the construction of infrastructure exert considerable pressure on the natural system and increase the damage potential on flood plains.
    Climate change tends to intensify the hydrological cycle, potentially resulting in increase in magnitude and frequency of extreme flood events or changes in the saisonality of floods. Sea level rise affects the flood risk of coastal areas and estuaries.
    Absolute protection from flooding is neither technically feasible nor economically and environmentally viable.</i>

<br>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<i>In many countries, rivers prone to floods are often carefully managed. Defences such as levees, bunds, reservoirs, and weirs are used to prevent rivers from bursting their banks. When these defences fail, emergency measures such as sandbags or portable inflatable tubes are used. Coastal flooding has been addressed in Europe and the Americas with coastal defences, such as sea walls, beach nourishment, and barrier islands.

    A dike is another method of flood protection. A dike lowers the risk of having floods compared to other methods. It can help prevent damage; however it is better to combine dikes with other flood control methods to reduce the risk of a collapsed dike.
    
    A weir, also known as a lowhead dam, is most often used to create millponds, but on the Humber River in Toronto, a weir was built near Raymore Drive to prevent a recurrence of the flooding caused by Hurricane Hazel in 1954, which destroyed nearly two fifths of the street.</i></p></li>
